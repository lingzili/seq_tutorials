## Quality control checkpoints

QC should be applied to every step of RNA-seq: raw sequencing reads, alignment and quantification. 
The tools involved are:

- **FastQC** <https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/>
- **MultiQC** <https://multiqc.info/>
- **RSeQC** <http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/>

## Evaluation of RNA integrity at transcript level

```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
tin.py -i *.bam -r ref.bed -o OUTPUT_PREFIX
```
